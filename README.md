Unit Tests for your Network
===========================

Any developer worth their salt tests their software.  The benefits are many:

 * Exercise the code

 * Reduce ambiguity by stating the desired behaviors twice (in the
   implementation, in the tests, and maybe even a third time in the
   documentation)

 * Enable code refactoring without changing expected behavior

With `fwunit`, you can do the same for security policies on your network.
